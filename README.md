# Single-cell Sequencing on Human Fibrous Dysplasia of the Bone  

This repository contains scripts associated with the manuscript:  
Single-cell analysis of human fibrous dysplasia bone reveals a fibrotic transcriptome and somatic, mosaic GNASR201H/C mutations in endothelial, perivascular, and stromal cells (pending publication).  

The project focuses on computational analysis of scRNA sequencing data from human FD and non-FD bone lesions.
